# Packt: The Weather App for Travelers

## Summary
Packt is designed to help you never overpack or underpack for your adventures. Using your destination and trip dates, Packt will suggest a list of items you should include in your suitcase based on the weather forecast. Whether it's looking like a snow day or a day to sun tan, Packt will make sure you have your snow boots or a bottle of sunscreen. You can even use the application as a personal check list by adding your own items, like a pair of skis or swim trunks. At a glance, Packt can give you a summary of the average weather during your trip. You can also look at a detailed weather forecast of each day of your trip. You may not have the perfect weather every day of your adventure, but Packt is here to make sure you at least have your umbrella for a rainy day.
